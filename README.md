 <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
 <p>
 It's the most incomplete of all, I studied HTML and CSS to edit my readme and to do a Flask Website in my private repositores, occult because it's not a focus to me now and this project I build together my teacher, not with confidence of my knowledge to do it alone (but, like ever, with some search or time I can do... don't forget, Google is the best friend of one person and I know how to insert some autentications and forms. With Bootstrap it's become more powerful.

 <h3>Database & SQL</h3>
 <p>
  Probably the most complete of all because a SQL Course is short and the adaptation of them is small for every DBS/SGBD. I know that exist a deeply knowledge about this theme and maybe I study them if I have the necessity to do it in the workplace.

 <h3>AWS Discovery Day</h3>
 <p> 
 It's a link to one intensiva training to AWS Practitioner Certificate, but because this method quick, maybe it's not so useful to the exam, just a shallow knowledge.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mR6dYmX6zWlkerXK47vjvY_ao8GRu8Rmad0fdUnub_k/edit?usp=sharing"> Link Here! </a>
